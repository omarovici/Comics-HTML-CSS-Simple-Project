I create a web page that serves as a showcase for comic books. This web page will display a collection of comic book posters, each accompanied by a brief description. When a user clicks on a comic book poster, they will be redirected to a dedicated page where they can read the full comic book.

That's the home page:

 And thats's the order form page:
